## OrnitoJS
Command line interface to start a new nodejs API based on express framework with Ornito structure defined from past projects.
- async await functions
- email builder using sendgrid service
- jobs using cronjob
- resources creation from command line
- relational and non-relational databases
- eslint
- tests
- convention over configuration
- knex.js

## Setup

**`Ornito JS`** allow you to easily start an API and code oriented to modules. strives to be an easily embeddable and beautiful command line interface for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

**`Ornito JS`** needs the following tools/techonologies to be able to start up.
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)
- Nodejs > 7.6.0
- Postgres
- Mongodb (if you're going to use it)
- Redis (if you're going to use it)

> **Note:** **`Ornito CLI`** is still in active development, we want to deliver more features like eslint, iugu integration and more.

## Command line
``` shell
npm install -g ornitojs
ornito start
```

## Running
``` shell
npm start
npm test
npm run linter
```

### Creating a new module
``` shell
ornito module user
```

### Database configuration
➡️ ./knexfile.js
```shell
development: {
  client: 'postgresql',
  connection: {
    database: 'yourdb',
    user: 'youruser',
    password: 'yourpassword'
  },
  pool: {
    min: 2,
    max: 10
  },
  migrations: {
    tableName: 'migrations'
  },
  seeds: {
    directory: './seeds/dev/'
  }
},
```

➡️ ./src/config/ENV.json
```shell
{
  "db_host": "postgres://youruser:yourpassword@localhost:5432/yourdb",
  "sendgrid_api_key": "",
  "iugu": {
    "url": "https://api.iugu.com/v1/",
    "api_key": "",
    "api_token": ""
  },
  "cloudinary": {
    "cloud_name": "",
    "api_key": "",
    "api_secret": "",
    "env_variable": ""
  }
}
```

### 🔧 Module structure
* **user**
    * **__tests__**
      * **user.spec.js**
    * **user.model.js**
    * **user.persistence.js**
    * **user.service.js**

### 💬 Structure description
* **__tests__:** We are using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) to test our models, but you can test endpoints, services and schema validations in this folder. The test suit is called from `npm test`
* **model:** Our entities represented by javascript classes. We're using [Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi) to validate our models, so when we receive a request, if the payload validation is not correct, we throw an error.
* **persistence:** Here you're able to require your database driver and start querying and inserting data to your choosen database. 
* **service:** We can validate params, integrate with 3rd part services, create rules, call our models, etc.

### 💡 To do:

* create database if does not exist (node-postgres)
* show eslint options (standard, standard2, airbnb...)
* create job from CLI
* option to inform database settings while creating structure (user, password, host)
* implicit filters on routes
* unify postgres database config
* error handler
* create mongodb module
